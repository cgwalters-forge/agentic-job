// Keep untrusted log text from becoming GitHub Actions workflow commands.
//
// The runner reads a command in every line a step writes, to stdout or
// stderr: `::name …::data` at the start of a line, after leading
// whitespace (`ActionCommand.TryParseV2`), and the older `##[name …]data`
// anywhere in one (`ActionCommand.TryParse`, with `IndexOf`). gh-aw's
// pinned handlers log the patch's first lines and stream git's output,
// both of which hold the agent's text: a commit message or a subject
// (git's `Applying: subject`) is free text, and `check` cannot refuse
// `##[` in the file content the preview prints too. A line of either
// that the runner read as a command could set this step's outputs where
// the handler writes none (`created_pr_url`, which conclude reports as
// the run's result), mask text from the log or stop command processing.
//
// This is the twin of crates/secure-host/src/workflow_commands.rs, which
// `run` and the sandbox checks use for the agent's own log; keep the two
// in step.

// `text` with both syntaxes broken by a space: `: :` and `## [`. Breaking
// them anywhere, not only at the start of a line, is what keeps it
// complete: no filter, reordering or interleaving of whole lines
// downstream can form one, and no runner state (a `stop-commands` token)
// is left behind. The space goes before the character that completes a
// syntax, so escaping a prefix again changes nothing before new text.
