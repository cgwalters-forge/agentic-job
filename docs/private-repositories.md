# Private repositories

> This text is LLM generated.

Runner-mode runs are **public-only**, not privately opt-in. The policy parser
retains private-run contracts, but `run --runner-home` refuses private targets
and the reusable agent job refuses private/unknown callers and targets even
with `private = true`. Do not compose a second-user job to bypass this refusal.
The second user was removed in [#2991](https://github.com/cgwalters-forge/agentic-job/pull/2991).
The remainder is a **legacy policy/reference design**,
not supported runner-only deployment instructions. The private-digest fixture
tests policy and output bounds, not current runner-mode launch acceptance.

Historically, runs were public-only by default. The public-only admission check stops private
source and configuration from becoming public run evidence. API errors, unknown
visibility and internal repositories are refused, not treated as public. A
caller can opt one kind of private run in: its own private repository as the
target, with `private = true` in every bounds file, the egress domain allowlist
on the agent machine and its runner's logs kept private. Such a run hands back
comments, reviews and other non-patch outputs, not a patch or a project
update. The run is refused if any checked condition below fails.

## What is published today

The reusable workflow checks target, agent-configuration and item repository
visibility on the policy machine; context resolution independently requires
public metadata. The run action checks target and agent-configuration visibility
again before artifact upload. This second check cannot recall material already
sent to inference, printed in a job log or written to a summary if visibility
changes during execution. The standalone CLI's bounds checks are not a private
workflow admission guarantee.

The digest regression suite executes the policy workflow's visibility step
with fixture API responses for the target, agent-configuration and item
repositories. Missing or contradictory visibility fields, non-boolean
`private`, internal visibility, malformed responses and API failures must
refuse a public caller's run. Even public-looking metadata from a failed API
call is not admission evidence. A confirmed-public control must pass. These
are offline admission tests, not proof of a live private deployment.

The [run evidence guide](workflow.md#what-a-run-leaves) lists the artifacts and
retention periods. The agent job prints a condensed transcript to its Actions
log and writes a rendered session/job summary. `agent-run` retains summaries,
the condensed log and outcome for 90 days; `agent-transcript` retains the fuller
transcript, tool output, agent logs and egress evidence for 30 days. Proposed
patches and safe-output requests are retained in `safe-outputs` for 30 days.
Policy, checked-output and applied-result artifacts record decisions and
destinations. Applying outputs creates durable forge objects such as PRs,
comments and reviews, potentially in a different repository.

On a public caller these are public run evidence (artifact downloads may require
authentication). A private caller's Actions access controls do not make a run
safe on their own: the target, caller, output repository, runner operator and
inference service can be different trust domains. Runner provisioning/diagnostic
logs are another publication surface; some runner providers publish them
separately from Actions. Shorter artifact retention does not retract logs,
downloads or already-applied outputs.

## What a private run would leak

A hostile job can copy source, configuration, filenames and issue text into
tool output, reasoning, summaries, patches or requested comments. Current
[redaction](workflow.md#github-reads-from-the-agent) removes known credential
values; it is not a private-source classifier. Source transformed, encoded or
split by a hostile process cannot be made safe by ordinary secret masking.
The agent also sends context to inference, whose access and retention policy
must be part of the confidentiality decision.

Network write restrictions alone do not stop exfiltration: a GET path can carry
private bytes to an attacker. The shipped reads-anywhere policy permits that
unless the destination is otherwise denied. Even an allowed shared service or
attacker-controlled subdomain can receive those bytes. Runner-user processes,
direct endpoints and local services must not provide a bypass around the
agent's proxy policy.

## Opting in

No run takes a private target now, whatever the bounds say: since the
sandbox user was removed
([#2989](https://github.com/cgwalters-forge/agentic-job/issues/2989)) the
agent is the runner's user, with no second user between it and `run`,
and `run` refuses a private policy. What follows is what the binary
admitted for a caller that composed its own agent job with a sandbox
user, kept for a private run's next design.

Add `private = true` at the top level of the caller's bounds file, and of the
organization's if there is one; both must set it. Then a run is admitted with a
private target only if all of these hold, each checked where it is enforced:

- **Evidence stays with the repository's audience.** The policy job admits a
  target that is not public only if the API reports it `private` and it is
  the calling repository. Its Actions logs, summaries and artifacts are then
  visible only to its collaborators. `agentic-job policy --private` refuses
  the run unless every bounds file opts in. It also requires the output
  repository to be the target, so that comments and status do not land in
  another, possibly public, repository; the workflow accepts no `item-repo`
  for a private run. It refuses `create_pull_request` and
  `push_to_pull_request_branch`: apply pushes a patch through a fork, which
  it checks without a credential, so a private fork is out of its reach.
  Off GitHub, every bounds file whose `[forgejo]` or `[gitlab]` section
  names the same `push_repo` admits
  `create_pull_request` when it is asked for by name (`all` leaves it
  out). Forgejo's and GitLab's apply push only to that fork, and only if
  the fork is private ([publishing to Forgejo](safe-outputs.md#publishing-to-forgejo),
  [to GitLab](safe-outputs.md#publishing-to-gitlab)).
  It also refuses `update_project`: a project's audience can read its
  fields, and that audience is not limited to the repository's audience.
  The run action repeats the visibility check before upload.
- **The proxy limits where the source can go.** `run` refuses a private
  policy unless the sandbox uses the egress proxy (`egress.proxy`) and the
  policy file the proxy enforces sets `[egress] mode = "allowlist"`
  ([domain allowlist](https://github.com/cgwalters-forge/actions/blob/main/secure-host/docs/egress.md#opt-in-domain-allowlist)), selected by
  `egress.policy` in the caller's configuration. That file may contain only
  `[[write]]` rules for git fetch's `POST` to paths ending in
  `/git-upload-pack`: any other rule can send data to storage at its endpoint.
  The shipped GraphQL rule, for example, would pass a mutation that another
  token posts to a public issue, so `gh`'s GraphQL reads are unavailable;
  REST reads (`gh api`) still work. Review every allowed domain, the inference
  endpoint and any `egress.direct` endpoint as a place the source can go:
  direct endpoints do not pass the proxy, and the check cannot judge them.
- **One read credential, for the target only.** The agent configuration
  and context repositories are cloned without a credential and stay
  public-only. `run` refuses
  a private policy without the job's read token (`github-reads`, the default).
  It clones the target with a git credential helper scoped to the target's
  clone URL. The helper reads the token from the sandbox user's token file. The
  token is never in a command line, URL or configuration value. The job token
  can read only the calling repository and expires with the job; no PAT is
  added. Policy and check keep read-only access; only apply holds a write
  credential.

One condition cannot be checked: **the runner's own logs must not be public.**
Use a runner whose provisioning and diagnostic logs only the repository's
audience can read, such as the caller's own. Some providers publish theirs.
The runner is a workflow input,
so a caller that opts in should not let a dispatcher choose it. Inference
access and retention are likewise the caller's decision.

Organization and repository identities come from the caller's repository: the
bounds files it owns and the repository the workflow runs in, never a workflow
input a dispatcher can set. BPF host evidence and release binaries improve other
boundaries; they do not make a private run safe on their own.

## A reference caller

**Legacy example only:** this fixture is not supported private-run setup.

[`.github/agentic-job/private-digest/`](../.github/agentic-job/private-digest/workflow.yml)
composes the conditions above for one job: a digest posted as one comment on
one issue of the private repository it runs in. It calls `policy.yml`,
`check.yml` and `apply.yml` and has an agent job of its own, which ran the
agent as the sandbox user behind the domain allowlist with the job's read
token; with that user removed, its run step now fails on `run`'s refusal of
a private target. It is not a workflow of this repository and nothing runs it here. A
repository that adopts it fills in placeholders for the agentic-job commit,
the issue and its own name. It also replaces a step that joins the inference
proxy's network, which this repository cannot supply. Left as they are, the
placeholders fail the run before the agent starts. `tests/private_digest.rs`
holds it to this page: its bounds refuse a missing opt-in, outputs or an item
in another repository, a patch and a project. Check refuses a comment anywhere
but the issue, a second comment and any other output. Its egress policy is one
`run` admits, and `policy.yml` refuses a public caller naming a private target.

The collector-to-check regression also exercises the raw hand-back. Collection
discards the unsupported `issue_number` alias; it does not treat it as a
routing instruction or reject its conflicts. The surviving `pr_number`,
`item_number` and `repo` fields are checked against the fixed destination.
A body-only comment therefore uses the caller's digest issue, even when the
raw output included discarded aliases naming other items. This is routing
coverage, not proof of private-run admission or live publication.

Body-size coverage runs the same path with a public policy. Collection keeps
up to 65,000 UTF-16 code units (not bytes or Unicode scalar values), appending
`[Content truncated due to length]` on overflow. A cut through a non-BMP
character omits that character rather than emitting an invalid surrogate.
Check accepts these truncated comments: its publication limits do not validate
the digest's structured content. Keep structured digests below the collector
limit and validate the collected body before publication; validation of only
the raw Markdown cannot prove its trailing JSON block survives collection.
The regression pins below/at/above cases for ASCII and non-BMP text, including
the truncation notice, without changing the upstream-compatible collector.

The host-configuration step resolves the egress policy against the caller
checkout before handing it to the host image, which reads it from `/`.
Container and subordinate-UID probes remain enabled even though the digest
itself does not use containers. The configuration pins the official UBI minimal
probe image by digest, and the allowlist admits `registry.access.redhat.com`
for its manifests and layers. The pinned v0.6.4 host also expects successful
package fetches when npm or cargo is installed, so `registry.npmjs.org`,
`index.crates.io` and `static.crates.io` are allowed for those probes.
No registry write rule is added. Like GitHub, these registries and their
subdomains can receive private source in GET paths or queries: the adopter
must approve those additional confidentiality destinations.
Revisit the image pin and allowlist together if the registry's download route
changes; a redirect outside the allowlist must fail closed.

Three gates stay manual, since nothing the run can check establishes them.
Before installing it, the operator confirms that the runner's provisioning
and diagnostic logs are private to the repository's audience. They approve
the inference service's access and retention, including the detection
model `check.yml` sends the proposed comment to when
`AGENTIC_JOB_DETECT_MODEL` is set. And the broker has to admit the
caller's own workflow file, which its identity token names
([inference](inference.md#which-workflows-a-broker-admits)).
