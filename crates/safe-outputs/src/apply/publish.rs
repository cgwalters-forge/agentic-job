//! GitHub's native publishing (agentic-job's `publish`): the output types
//! the bounds route away from gh-aw's handlers (`native_handlers`, GitHub
//! only) published without them, as gh-aw's handlers at apply.yml's pin
//! publish them: the same requests in the same order, with the same
//! bodies, and the same records of them (`safe-output-items.jsonl`,
//! `safe-output-errors.json`, the step's outputs and summary). For the
//! types of [`HANDLERS`], on the [`Publisher`] for GitHub and its client;
//! agentic-job's `tests/data/publication` records what gh-aw sends.
//!
//! The caller reads the requests, the handlers' configuration and the
//! run's variables ([`Run::read`]), gives the check job's [`Upload`] and
//! the GitHub client, and writes each log line [`apply`] gives it as the
//! workflow command it names, escaped as its log takes untrusted text.
//!
//! apply.yml runs this after the steps that edit the requests and the
//! guard that leaves out what an earlier attempt applied, all of which
//! stay as they are, and before gh-aw's handler step, which reads only
//! the requests this leaves it (`--remainder`). Each request goes to one
//! of the two: the remainder is written before anything is published,
//! and not at all when this refuses, so gh-aw's step then finds none.
//! A pull request or push that fails here has it written again: gh-aw's
//! handler manager starts each comment after a failed one with a warning
//! that its changes were not applied, and its comments are left gh-aw's.
//! The routed requests come first in the run's order and are published
//! first, so the order of everything published is the run's. Review
//! comments are buffered and submitted in one review after the other
//! routed requests, as gh-aw's manager submits them after everything:
//! a run with them leaves gh-aw's handlers nothing to publish.
//!
//! Where gh-aw's handlers would do what this does not, this refuses the
//! run before the first write rather than do something else: a request
//! after one of gh-aw's types, a field or setting this does not read, a
//! temporary ID, a workflow input gh-aw reads from a file this ignores,
//! a mention it would look up, or a label this cannot tell gh-aw would
//! keep as written. A pull request or push that fails is not
//! followed by the routed comments after it, which gh-aw would post with
//! a note of its own; a push goes only onto the head the run was asked
//! for, where gh-aw's handler would apply the patch on a branch rewritten
//! since; and nothing here falls back to opening an issue or a pull
//! request, or commenting on a discussion. gh-aw reads settings this does not
//! (`GH_AW_SAFE_OUTPUT_MESSAGES`, `GH_AW_TRACKER_ID` and the like):
//! apply.yml sets none of them for either.
