//! `agentic-job sandbox exec`: one command as the sandbox user, for a
//! step of a job that runs no agent.
//!
//! After `sandbox setup` the steps of a job are the runner's user's,
//! without root; a step that runs code the job does not trust (a build
//! script from a pull request, a dependency's install hook) can go one
//! further and run it as the sandbox user, which has none of the job's
//! files, tokens or environment and reaches the network as the
//! configuration says. This is the way in for such a step, the same one
//! `run` takes for an agent ([`super::enter`]), and it gives its caller
//! no privilege the helper does not already give it.
//!
//! As a step's shell it takes the step's script as a file, which the
//! sandbox user could not read where the runner keeps it:
//!
//! ```yaml
//! - shell: agentic-job sandbox exec --stdin {0} -- bash -eo pipefail -s
//!   run: make check
//! ```
