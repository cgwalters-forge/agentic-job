//! `agentic-job sandbox setup`: create the sandbox user and close its
//! routes to credentials and root. Run as root, once, on a machine that is
//! thrown away after the job.
//!
//! The boundary is the separate uid: it cannot read another uid's
//! `/proc/PID/environ` or memory, and has no sudo. The rest closes what
//! runner images leave open to every local user, which starts to matter
//! once something runs as a user other than the runner's.
//!
//! Setup is the last thing that runs as root with the runner's user's own
//! sudo. It ends by taking that away ([`lock_runner`]): every step after
//! it, the supervisor (`sandbox check`, `run`) and the job's own, runs as
//! an unprivileged user that has root do only what the helper allows
//! ([`super::helper`]). docs/sandbox-check.md says what that closes and
//! how the probes prove it.
