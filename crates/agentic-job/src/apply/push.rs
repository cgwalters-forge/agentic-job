//! `agentic-job push`: where a run's commit goes on GitHub, read from the
//! forge and never from the agent or a pull request's text.
//!
//! `push resolve` is policy.yml's, with the policy job's read-only token:
//! the branch, head and current base of the pull request a run pushes to.
//! `agentic-job policy` then checks the branch against the caller's bounds
//! and pins the head the run starts from. The branch may be in the
//! repository itself or in any fork: whose it is and whether apply's
//! account may push there, only apply knows (#553).
//!
//! `push target` is apply.yml's fork step, with apply's token, before
//! anything is fetched or pushed: the repository a pull request's branch
//! is pushed to, which gh-aw's handler is then given as the only one it
//! may push to. That is the token's own fork of the output repository,
//! made if missing, with Actions turned off, or for a push the pull
//! request's head repository, whoever opened it. A replacement (RC-023)
//! is pushed with a lease on that head, past the handler, so these checks
//! are the only ones it gets.
//!
//! A push with the user's token starts the head repository's `push` and
//! `pull_request` workflows on the agent's commit, with their secrets:
//! - only the pull request's own branch, and never the head repository's
//!   default branch or a protected one, which take reviewed changes
//!   (gh-aw's handler refuses those too, but goes on where it cannot read);
//! - a repository the user cannot push to is refused here, with that
//!   reason, rather than by the forge mid-apply;
//! - never with `.github` exempted, as a workflow file the agent wrote
//!   would run there with them: only the user's fork has Actions off;
//! - a branch of the output repository itself, or of another's fork of
//!   it, only where that repository accepts it ([`OWNER_BRANCHES`] naming
//!   it on its default branch, which only a commit there adds), and of no
//!   other repository: write access is given for people's commits, not as
//!   an acceptance that the fork's own workflows run an agent's with the
//!   fork's secrets. The output repository's CI runs a fork's commit as a
//!   fork's.
