//! `agentic-job apply`: publish what `check` accepted to a forge that is
//! not GitHub, from a job of its own that holds the write token. GitHub's
//! apply is still gh-aw's handlers in apply.yml, but for the types the
//! bounds route to [`publish`] (comments, new pull requests, labels and
//! closing);
//! this is the first slice of moving publishing behind [`Publisher`]
//! (#1346), for Forgejo and the outputs in [`SUPPORTED`], and for GitLab
//! and those in [`GITLAB_SUPPORTED`]. On GitHub,
//! [`secondary`] opens the policy's secondary pull request after the
//! handlers.
//!
//! The input is the check job's upload: check's `report.json` and the
//! patch beside it. That upload went through a machine other than the
//! agent's, but apply holds it to the policy again rather than take the
//! report's word: the same counts, types, destinations, marker, handler
//! limits and patch rules check applies, and a patch that is byte for
//! byte the size check reported. Everything is decided before the first
//! write ([`plan`]), and what only the forge can say (an item's kind, a
//! label's ID) is asked before it too ([`Publisher::preflight`]), so a
//! refusal leaves the forge as it was.
//!
//! The caller may also have it set a commit status, after every other
//! write ([`Op::Status`]): its state, commit and link are the caller's,
//! and its context is [`STATUS_CONTEXT`]. No request can ask for one.
