//! [`Publisher`] for GitLab, through its REST API v4: a note on the
//! caller's issue or merge request, and a merge request from a branch
//! pushed over git to the fork the bounds name, opened on the fork with
//! the repository as its `target_project_id`. Never a branch of the
//! repository itself, for the reason Forgejo's publisher gives. Also an
//! issue, labels added to or removed from an issue or a merge request,
//! and one closed with a note saying why; a commit pushed on the branch of
//! the policy's merge request, in that fork, under a lease on the head the
//! run was asked for; and the caller's commit status.
//!
//! GitLab numbers issues and merge requests apart within a project (`#5`
//! and `!5`, each an `iid`), so a note's target kind is the caller's
//! (`--comment-target-kind`), and a label change's or a closing's is its
//! request's target field, never guessed from the number. A project is
//! read by its URL-encoded path, its answer held to that path, and then
//! written to by the ID read, so that a project renamed or moved away is
//! not written to.
//!
//! GitLab creates a label it is given and lacks, so every label is looked
//! for among the project's (its groups' included) by its exact name before
//! any write, and again just before its own; apply creates none. A label
//! is added only where the item lacks it and removed only where it has it,
//! and closing writes nothing to an item closed or merged already, so a
//! re-run changes nothing more.
//!
//! The text is filtered before it gets here ([`super::mentions`]):
//! GitLab's mentions, `@all` and `@here` among them, and its quick
//! actions, a line starting with `/` that GitLab would run with the
//! token's rights.
//!
//! The token goes in one header, `Authorization: Bearer`, never a URL or
//! an argument; git gets it as `oauth2` over Basic through its
//! environment, and every error is scrubbed of it.
