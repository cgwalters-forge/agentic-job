//! `agentic-job event`: decide whether the event that started a workflow
//! may start an agent run, and if so turn it into the run's task context.
//!
//! A caller's workflow may be triggered by anything (`on:` is the
//! caller's), and the event's payload is a stranger's text: the title of
//! an issue, the body of a comment, the name of a branch. This command is
//! the one place that reads it. It decides from the caller's bounds file
//! (the `[trigger]` table) who may start a run and from which events,
//! fail closed, and writes the untrusted text into the task file behind a
//! fence it cannot close, so the agent reads it as data. The decision and
//! the targets (the triggering issue or pull request, the pull request's
//! base and head) go to `event.json` for the workflow, which has the token
//! to fetch the actor's permission and to react; the binary holds none.
//!
//! This is gh-aw's `pre_activation` and `activation` jobs in one command:
//! its role check (`roles:` as an exact allowlist, bots refused unless
//! listed, a comment's actor must be its author), its fork rule (a pull
//! request from another repository is refused by default), its slash
//! commands (the body must start with the command) and its sanitized
//! context, with one difference: the text is fenced.
