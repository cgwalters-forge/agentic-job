//! The task file an event-triggered run reads: the caller's own task

//! gh-aw substitutes the sanitized text where the prompt names it and

//! it is, capped, stripped of what a terminal or a model could mistake
//! for structure, and fenced with more backticks than any run it holds,
//! so that nothing in it can end the fence early. Mentions, references
//! and URLs are left as written: they matter when the agent copies text
