//! One ACP session, from starting the agent to its result, recorded as it
//! goes.
//!
//! The session is the task's prompt turn, and what the run's budget
//! (`budget`) adds to it: notices, sent as prompts of their own while the
//! turn runs, to the agents that queue them behind the step they are on
//! (`AgentSpec::notices`; another would end its turn for one); then, near
//! a limit, a `session/cancel` of the turn and one more prompt turn in
//! which the agent hands back; and at the limit a last `session/cancel`.
//!
//! When the session ends, the process group started for the agent is
//! killed, and then every process of the sandbox user (`process`): the
//! agent runs in a login session of that user's, where a signal to the
//! group does not reach.
