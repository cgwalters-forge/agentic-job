//! The one check of a configuration, for every command that reads one.
//!
//! `sandbox setup` and `run` each refuse a configuration they cannot
//! use, and `agentic-job config`, which writes the file both read, has
//! to refuse it first: `run` starts minutes after the machine was set
//! up, which is late to learn of a missing key. So that the three cannot
//! drift, none of them checks a table itself. [`Config::check_host`] is
//! what `sandbox setup` needs to hold, and what every entry into the
//! sandbox holds again (`sandbox::enter`); [`Config::check`] is that
//! and what `run` needs. Each takes its checked values from here.
//!
//! Only what the file alone decides is checked here. What depends on the
//! machine (that the sandbox user exists, that a path of the file is
//! there) or on the run (the task, `--meta`, the policy) stays with the
//! command that meets it.
