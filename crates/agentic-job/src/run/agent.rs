//! The agent's configuration: the files that point Claude Code or
//! opencode at the inference proxy with the run's token, and at nothing
//! else.
//!
//! The run token is written to one file in the sandbox user's home, mode
//! 0600 in a directory of mode 0700, and nowhere else: not a command
//! line, not an environment a wrapper would show, not the root-owned
//! settings. That is tidiness and not the boundary. The agent can read
//! its token and run any command; what contains it is the sandbox user
//! and the egress proxy.
//!
//! **Claude Code** gets four files, none taken from anywhere but this
//! binary and the run:
//!
//! - [`CLAUDE_ENV_FILE`], the environment that points it at the proxy,
//!   the token included, which [`super::launch`] applies;
//! - [`MANAGED_SETTINGS_FILE`], root's, with no secret. Claude Code
//!   applies the `env` of settings files over its own environment, the
//!   target repository's `.claude/settings.json` included, and managed
//!   settings over those: so the endpoint and the switches to other
//!   providers are pinned there, and hooks and permission rules are
//!   limited to managed ones, of which there are none, which keeps every
//!   command and edit a permission request the session answers and
//!   records;
//! - [`CLAUDE_SETTINGS_FILE`], its user settings, which turn off its own
//!   attribution ([`claude_user_settings`]);
//! - [`CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS_FILE`], its instructions for an unattended
//!   run.
//!
//! **opencode** gets its global configuration, [`OPENCODE_CONFIG_FILE`],
//! with one provider, the proxy, and the token as that provider's key.
//!
//! **Vibe** gets its user configuration, [`VIBE_CONFIG_FILE`], with both
//! built-in providers as the proxy and the token as their header.
//!
//! Each may take part of this from a public repository the caller
//! names (`[agent] config-repo`): opencode its configuration, which must
//! define exactly one provider (its address and key are replaced), an
//! `AGENTS.md` and an optional profile; Claude Code its instructions;
//! Vibe only the models and the active model of its `config.toml`.
//! With skills enabled, the root `skills/` tree is also installed.
//! Nothing else in that repository is used: opencode would also merge
//! other configuration files and run plugins, tools and commands found
//! beside its configuration, none of which the provider check covers.
//!
//! With `[agent] skills`, each also gets this binary's skills and
//! subagents ([`skills`]), the same text for all, so that a task can say
//! "use the implement skill" rather than spell the procedure out.
//!
//! An agent is code here, and not an entry of a table a caller writes,
//! on purpose: what keeps its inference at the proxy is different for
//! each one and has to be known, not described. "Adding an agent" in
//! docs/layout.md says what a new one takes.
