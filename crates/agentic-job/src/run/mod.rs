//! `agentic-job run`: clone the target, get the run token, configure the
//! agent, start it in the sandbox, drive it within the limits, end the
//! run at the inference proxy, take what the agent hands back, and leave
//! under `--out` what may be uploaded. Steps 6a and 6b of docs/plan.md,
//! on top of [`crate::session`].
//!
//! `run` is the runner's user. Everything it does in the agent's files
//! (the clone, the configuration, the probes, the hand-back) it does as
//! the sandbox user, through [`enter`].
//!
//! Under `--out` a run that ended leaves `run/` (`summary.json`,
//! `summary.md`, `condensed.log`, `outcome.json`), `transcript.tar.zst`
//! and, if the agent handed anything back, `safe-outputs/`: in the old
//! tree's names and schemas, redacted, and only if they passed the gate
//! of [`upload`]. `work/` beside them is `run`'s own and is never
//! uploaded.
//!
//! Four things it must never do, each of which the old tree could:
//!
//! - **Run uncapped without being told to.** A run that cannot announce
//!   itself to the proxy does not start ([`Exit::NotStarted`]), and a cap
//!   on model requests that nothing would count is refused rather than
//!   dropped.
//! - **Leave the agent running.** The session kills the sandbox user's
//!   processes when it returns. `run` does the same when it is told to
//!   stop (a signal), and when it gives up before the session started.
//! - **Leave the token live.** Whatever way the run ends, it is ended at
//!   the proxy, and [`INFERENCE_FILE`] says whether that worked.
//! - **Publish what quotes a live token.** A run that was not ended at
//!   the proxy leaves nothing to upload.
//!
//! The target is cloned before the run is registered, not after as the
//! plan's summary has it: a clone needs no token, and a run that fails to
//! clone then leaves no registration behind for the proxy to remember.
