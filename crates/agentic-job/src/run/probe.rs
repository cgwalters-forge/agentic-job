//! file, private to the sandbox user, and nowhere else that user can

//!
//! These are the token's part of the old tree's
//! `agent-isolation-check.mjs`. The probes that need no token are
//! `sandbox check`'s (step 5), which `run` will call again here too. One
//! of the old probes is left to that step, since it needs the container
//! image `[sandbox.check]` names: that a container's subordinate uid
//! cannot read the file.

//! The token goes to every search on standard input, never on a command
//! line.
