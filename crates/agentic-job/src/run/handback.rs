//! What a run hands back, as gh-aw's safe outputs: the requests the agent
//! wrote (JSON Lines, [`AGENT_OUTPUTS`] in its home), and for a pull
//! request a patch of its working tree. The patch is made here and not
//! taken from the agent, the way gh-aw's own server makes one from the
//! git state: `git format-patch` of one commit against the commit the run
//! started from, with gh-aw's base-commit header.
//!
//! Everything here is the agent's: its lines, its files, its checkout and
//! that checkout's git configuration. So every file is read and every git
//! command run through a [`Runner`], which in a run is the sandbox user: a
//! link the agent planted then reaches only what the agent could read
//! anyway. Nothing is trusted for being written here either; `check`
//! reads all of it again on another machine.
//!
//! One thing differs from the old tree's `handback.mjs` on purpose. There
//! the commit's message was the pull request's title alone, and a worker
//! on the operator's machine wrote the real one when it applied the
//! change. Nobody does that for a change applied by a job, so the message
//! is the title and body of the pull request's request, with the
//! configured trailers.
