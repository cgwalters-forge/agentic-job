//! The rules for a patch, read from its text.
//!
//! The patch is `git format-patch`'s output for one commit, made by `run`
//! with git running as the sandbox user in a checkout whose configuration
//! the agent controls. So all of it is untrusted, and it is later given
//! to `git am` on a machine that can write. Two readers of one text can
//! disagree about what it says: a patch in the commit message, a second
//! mail, an encoded body or a header only git understands would each be
//! applied by git and missed by a reader that looks for `diff --git`
//! lines alone. So the text is read as git reads it, line by line, and
//! must be exactly the shape `format-patch` writes. From the first file
//! on, every line has to be accounted for: a file's header, a hunk of the
//! length its header gives, or the signature. Before that is the commit
//! message, which is free text, so there the lines git would read as the
//! start of a patch or of a mail are refused.
//!
//! One thing the text cannot show. Where a patch does not apply as it
//! is, `git am --3way` looks for the file its `index` line names by
//! content, and with rename detection may apply the change to another
//! path than the one read here. So the paths are part of the verdict
//! ([`PatchReading::files`]), for the job that applies the patch to
//! compare with what changed, and that job should apply without rename
//! detection (`merge.renames=false`).
