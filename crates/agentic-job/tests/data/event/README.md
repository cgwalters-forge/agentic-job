# Event and API fixtures

JSON files imitating the GitHub Actions event payload (the file at
`$GITHUB_EVENT_PATH`) for each trigger, plus `permission-*.json`, the
response of `GET /repos/octo/repo/collaborators/LOGIN/permission`.

They are hand-written in the shape of GitHub's webhook payloads and REST
responses, trimmed to the fields the tests need plus a few realistic extras.
They were not recorded from a live run.

Everything refers to one invented repository, `octo/repo` (id 100), unless
the file name says otherwise (`pull_request-fork.json` has a head repository
`mallory/repo`, id 999).

`pull-13.json`, `pull-13-fork.json` and `pull-15.json` are the response of
`GET /repos/octo/repo/pulls/N`, as the workflow fetches it for a comment on
a pull request (`--pull-request`): #13 with its head in the repository and
with its head in `mallory/repo`, and #15, another pull request than the one
`issue_comment-pr-command.json` is on. `pull_request-labeled.json` is
`pull_request-same-repo.json` with the action `labeled`.
