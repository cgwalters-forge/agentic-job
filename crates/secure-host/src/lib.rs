//! secure-host: secure a CI host for untrusted steps, and prove it.
//!
//! The host's side of agentic-job, for any job that runs code it does not
//! trust: it knows nothing of agents, inference or safe outputs, and
//! agentic-job depends on it, never the other way round. It holds the
//! host setup ([`setup`]), the network rules, the egress proxy and the
//! helper among it, and the probes that prove it ([`check`]); agentic-job
//! adds its agents and session through [`setup::Program`]. The image
//! still lives in agentic-job's `secure_host` module, and agentic-job's
//! `sandbox` re-exports these at their old paths. docs/layout.md has the
//! map.
