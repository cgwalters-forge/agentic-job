//! `agentic-job secure-host world-write OBJECT`: load the access-time
//! world-write policy as root, before `sandbox setup`, which refuses a host
//! without it. Every kernel operation goes through bpftool; this program
//! only decides what to ask of it and checks what it reports.
//!
//! OBJECT is the release's `world_write.bpf.o`, taken by its pinned
//! checksum with the binary, or compiled with a build of the same source:
//! no compiler here. The threat is any user but the owner changing a
//! world-writable file or non-sticky directory on the root filesystem
//! (cgwalters-forge/actions's secure-host/docs/world-write.md). Every
//! refusal leaves the step failed; nothing
//! falls back to running without the policy.
//!
//! The same object holds the runner-read rule, which stays off unless
//! `--deny-runner-reads` asks for it: no task of the runner's user reads
//! (`/proc/PID/environ` and the like) another of that user's tasks that it
//! is not an ancestor of, Runner.Worker excepted. The threat is a step
//! reading the tokens in the environment of a process an earlier step of
//! the job left running.
