//! `sandbox.close-resolved`: systemd-resolved answers any local user over
//! its Varlink socket and the system bus, and asks upstream as itself, so
//! the network rules on the sandbox user's uids do not stop it sending
//! names out (`<data>.attacker.example`) around the egress proxy. Its stub
//! on loopback's port 53 is closed by those rules already.
//!
//! Both ways in are closed by who may connect, not by uid ranges, so
//! that the sandbox user's subordinate uids in a container, which have
//! no names, are refused as well: the sockets lose other users' access
//! (the runner's too: they are resolved's own and its group's), and a bus
//! policy refuses calls to resolved by default and allows them to root
//! and the runner's user. Both are set up where resolved is not running
//! yet as well, since the bus or a socket would start it, and drop-ins
//! keep the sockets closed when they are made again. Glibc's lookups through nsswitch's
//! `dns` go to the stub and need neither (Ubuntu's runner image has no
//! `resolve` there).
