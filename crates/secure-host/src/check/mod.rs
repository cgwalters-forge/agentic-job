//! `agentic-job sandbox check`: prove, as the sandbox user, that the
//! sandbox holds, before an agent is started in it.
//!
//! Each probe is something the sandbox user tries and must not manage,
//! and each has a positive control: the same attempt somewhere it should
//! work. Without the control, a probe that fails because a program is
//! missing reads as a protection that holds.
//!
//! The probes are a function, [`probes`], because agentic-job's `run`
//! repeats them with `[sandbox.check] before-agent` and the host test
//! that removes protections calls it. None of them is of the run token:
//! those are agentic-job's own (`run::probe`), made once the token is in
//! place. They read the host's tables of any [`HostFile`]; agentic-job's
//! `sandbox::check` maps the result to its exit states.
//! cgwalters-forge/actions's secure-host/docs/probes.md lists them all.
//!
//! The probes are methods of `Checker` in the modules under this one:
//! `on_host`, `runner` (the runner's own user, which setup
//! has taken root from) and `net`; what a pass leaves for a later check
//! in the same job is `record`.
